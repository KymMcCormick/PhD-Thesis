                <p><b>Participant Selection and Purpose of Study</b></p>
                <p>
                    You are invited to participate in a study of
                    eyewitness identification. This project seeks to inform
                    the justice system in ways that provide opportunities to
                    maximise the identification of guilty suspects while also
                    minimising the risk of identifying innocent suspects.
                    You were selected as a possible participant in this study
                    because you accepted our HIT on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
                </p>
                <p><b>Description of Study and Risks</b></p>
                <p>
                    If you decide to participate we will ask you to <b>watch a
                    short video clip</b>, which will be followed by a simple
                    visual comparison task.
                    You will then be <b>shown a number of photographs of faces</b> in
                    a mock lineup. You will be <b>asked to make various
                    identification decisions</b> using this lineup of faces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No discomforts or inconveniences besides some boredom are
                    reasonably expected. No risks are reasonably expected as a
                    result of your participation in this study.
                    We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive
                    any benefits from this study.
                </p>

                <p><b>Study duration</b></p>
                <p>
                    In total, this study should take approximately 10 minutes.
                    Please make sure you can have this time free of interruptions
                    before beginning.
                </p>
