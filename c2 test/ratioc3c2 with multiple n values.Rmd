```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown



```{r cars}
n <- 4
x <- seq(1,n, by = 1)


f <- seq(0, 1, by=0.01)

pr <- function(n,f,x){
  for i in (1:n)
  y[i] <- sum(choose(n-1,x-1)*(1-f)^(x-1)*f^(n-x)/x)
}




#c <- function(n,f,x,p_x){
#  p_x/1-
#}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
r <- pr(n,.5,x); r
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
